## 🧮 Calculation Breakdown

### Formula Step-by-Step

```dart
// Step 1: Get total working days in month
final totalWorkingDays = WorkingDaysCalculator.getWorkingDaysInMonth(2025, 9);
// Result: 22 days (excluding weekends and holidays)

// Step 2: Calculate 60% target
final targetDays = (0.6 * totalWorkingDays).ceil();
// Result: ceil(0.6 * 22) = ceil(13.2) = 14 days

// Step 3: Calculate days still needed
final daysNeeded = max(0, targetDays - attendedDays);
// Result: max(0, 14 - 8) = 6 days

// Step 4: Get remaining working days
final remainingDays = WorkingDaysCalculator.getRemainingWorkingDaysInMonth(currentDate);
// Result: Count working days from tomorrow to end of month

// Step 5: Determine achievability
if (daysNeeded == 0) {
  return "Target met";
} else if (daysNeeded > remainingDays) {
  return "Not achievable";
} else {
  return "Required for 60%: $daysNeeded more days";
}
```
