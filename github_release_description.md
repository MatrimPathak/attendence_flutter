# 🚀 OfficeLog v1.2.0 - Smart Monthly Compliance Tracking

## 🎯 **Major Features**

### 📊 **3-Day Weekly Rule Implementation**

Transform your attendance tracking with our new intelligent **3-day weekly rule**:

-   **Smart Calculation**: Only counts complete Monday-to-Sunday weeks
-   **Fair Assessment**: No more inflated requirements from partial weeks

### 🎨 **Clean Monthly Compliance Dashboard**

Say goodbye to cluttered weekly breakdowns! New streamlined UI features:

-   **📈 Required Days**: Based on actual complete weeks in the month
-   **✅ Days Attended**: Clear count of your logged attendance

-   **🎯 Compliance %**: Your progress toward the 60% target

**Color-Coded Status:**

-   🟢 **Green** ≥ 60% (On Track)
-   🟡 **Yellow** 55-59% (Borderline)

### 🔔 **Smart Notification System**

Never miss your attendance goals with intelligent reminders:

-   **Proactive Monitoring**: Background worker checks compliance daily
-   **Contextual Alerts**: Only notifies when you actually need more days
