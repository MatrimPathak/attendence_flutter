**Release Date:** September 15, 2025  
**Version:** 1.2.0+2  
**Build:** 10200  

## 🚀 New Features & Major Updates

### 📊 **3-Day Weekly Rule Implementation**
- **New Attendance Logic**: Changed from traditional daily attendance to a **3-day weekly rule**
- **Monthly Compliance**: Required days = `Complete Weeks × 3 days`
- **Smart Week Calculation**: Only counts complete Monday-to-Sunday weeks within each month
- **Fair Targets**: More realistic attendance requirements based on actual work weeks

### 🎯 **Monthly Compliance Dashboard**
- **Clean UI**: Replaced cluttered weekly breakdown with focused monthly compliance card
- **Key Metrics Display**:
  - Required Days (based on complete weeks)
  - Days Attended
  - Still Needed
  - Compliance Percentage
- **Color-Coded Status**:
  - ✅ **Green** ≥ 60% (On Track)
  - ⚠️ **Yellow** 55-59% (Borderline)
  - ❌ **Red** < 55% (Behind)

### 📅 **Simplified Calendar View**
- **Removed**: Complex weekly coloring that caused confusion
- **Enhanced**: Clean calendar showing only checkmarks (✔️) on attended days
- **Focus**: Emphasizes actual attendance rather than arbitrary weekly groupings

### 🔔 **Smart Notification System**
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Background worker checks attendance daily
- **Intelligent Reminders**: Only sends notifications when:
  - Compliance is below 60%
  - User still needs more days
  - It's a working day
- **Auto-Stop**: Notifications stop once 60% compliance is achieved
- **Example**: *"You still need 2 more days this month to meet 60% attendance."*

### ⚡ **Dynamic Updates**
